## 1. Sequencer & Arrangement

### 1.3 Automation targets for send/return routing

- [ ] **Expose track send levels and return-bus volume/mute as automatable
  targets.** Today the automation DSL covers instrument macros, module params,
  track mixer params (Volume/Pan/Mute/Pitch), and `global:MasterVolume`, but not a
  track's send level to a return bus, nor a return bus's own volume/mute. So
  transition-only effects (reverse-reverb swells, granular/spectral throws for a
  few bars) can't be automated — `set_track_send` only sets a static value, forcing
  a permanently-low constant send instead. Requested target DSL:
  `track:Send:<return_id>` (and the relative `track:Send:<return_id>` on the host
  track) plus `return:<return_id>:Volume` / `return:<return_id>:Mute`.

  This is a **real-time audio feature, not a quick fix** — deliberately deferred
  from the 2026-07-20 MCP feedback batch (items 1–7 shipped). Scope, in order:
  1. **`synth_sequencer`** — add `AutomationTarget` variants (e.g.
     `TrackSend { track: Option<TrackId>, return_bus: ReturnBusId }` and
     `Return { bus: ReturnBusId, param: ReturnParam { Volume, Mute } }`). They must
     stay `Eq`/`Hash` (lane-map keys) with serde + `display_name` + the
     `to_target_string` DSL round-trip.
  2. **`synth_engine` mixdown** — apply the lane values per block to the send
     matrix and return-bus gain/mute, RT-safe (no alloc/lock on the audio thread;
     mirror the pre-keyed slot pattern used by `mod_grid.track_offsets`).
  3. **Offline render parity** — `arrangement_render` must apply the same so
     analysis/export match live playback.
  4. **MCP** — `build_(live_)automation_target` DSL parse/format, structured
     target variant, boundary validation (return id exists), and **discovery** in
     `list_mod_targets`, `get_instrument_automation_targets`, and
     `list_automation_lanes`.
  5. **GUI (optional, separate)** — draw/edit these lanes in the arrangement view.

  A partial version (DSL + discovery without the engine application) is worse than
  nothing: it creates lanes that silently do nothing. Land 1–4 together. **L,
  feature.**

## 2. Sound Design — Expanded Capabilities

### 2.1 Sample & wavetable import

- [ ] Sample import — load .wav files as oscillator source or in granular synth
- [ ] Wavetable import — load custom wavetables (Serum format, single-cycle .wav)

### 2.2 Alternative tunings

- [ ] **Support tunings other than 12-TET.** Today the pitch path hardcodes 12-tone equal
  temperament when converting `MidiNote` → `Hertz`. Route that conversion through a pluggable
  tuning table so the synth can play just intonation (pure integer ratios like `3/2`, `5/4`),
  microtonal systems (19/22/31-EDO, quarter-tones), and arbitrary historical/non-Western scales.
- [ ] **Load Scala `.scl` files** as the import format — the de facto standard for sharing
  tunings (scale steps given in cents or as frequency ratios). Parsing a `.scl` file fills the
  tuning table from the previous item.

### 2.3 Expression & articulation

**Remaining open work from the retired note-expression roadmap:**

- [ ] **Phase D residual — automate master/return effect params.** A `Filter` can be
  placed on the master or a return bus and set today (`set_master_effect_parameter` /
  `set_return_effect_parameter`), but its cutoff **cannot be swept by an automation
  lane**: `AutomationTarget::Module` resolves only against instrument-owned modules
  (`synth_engine.rs:~3293`, `instruments.iter_mut().find(...)`). Add a target variant
  (e.g. `AutomationTarget::{MasterEffect, ReturnEffect}` keyed by slot + `param_id`)
  dispatched through the same override layer as A2. Delivers exact *shared* SID-style
  filter sweeps. **S** task — build only when a tune genuinely needs a shared (not
  per-instrument) automated sweep; per-instrument sweeps are already covered by A2.

### 2.5 Script-exposed params follow-ups

The shipped `Script` module is a one-program **4 CV-in (`in1..in4`) / 4 CV-out
(`out1..out4`)** node. `Script` and `AudioScript` expose user-declared `param`
knobs through the GUI, Mod Matrix, automation, persistence, and cross-script reads.

- [ ] **In-app GUI eyeball (pending verification, not a bug).** The 4-in/4-out faceplate
  ports, the ƒx editor's live control-ports status, and the declared-knob rendering are
  wired + unit/integration-tested but never clicked through in the running app. Confirm: a
  `param drive = 0.5` shows a **Drive** knob that changes the sound; the ƒx popup lists the
  declared params; rewiring a cable into `in1` changes the read without editing the script;
  editing a live script to add a `param` makes the knob appear with no audio glitch.
- [ ] **Cross-script reads don't see automation overrides.** `resolve_param_source`
  (`voice.rs`) reads another script's knob (`scr-1.drive`) as its *stored base* value via
  `get_param` — the transient sequencer-automation override (and the per-block mod-offset,
  deliberately) are excluded. So one script reading another's *automated* knob sees the
  un-automated value. Minor v1 limitation; if it matters, route the read through the knob
  store's effective-minus-offset value. **S**.
- [ ] **Optional per-CV-port display labels (`in1 "rate"` / `out1 "pitch"`).** Deferred from
  plan §2.A — the `param` string label/tooltip shipped, but the cosmetic per-port faceplate
  labels did not; ports show bare `in1..in4` / `out1..out4`. Needs a small header-declaration
  grammar addition (a bare `in1 "label"` statement) + carrying the label onto the port
  descriptor (it must NOT change the port id, so no cable churn). **S–M**, purely cosmetic.

### 2.6 Per-oscillator glide (portamento)

The eight pitched oscillators have shipped with an opt-in `glide_time` parameter.

- [ ] **In-app eyeball (pending — not a bug).** Two oscillators in one voice: set
  `glide_time > 0` on one, confirm it audibly portamentos between notes while the
  other jumps; confirm the **Glide** knob renders and changes the sound; confirm
  no-glide patches sound unchanged and that pitch-bend/vibrato still track on a
  gliding oscillator.
- [ ] **Extend the opt-in param to the other pitch-tracking sources.** `voice_synth`,
  `vocal_tract`, `fof`, `ring_mod`, `padsynth`, `sampler` took the `VoicePitch`
  signature change but not the `glide_time` param (plan §5 "candidates"). Each is a
  small `OscGlide` adoption if wanted. **S each.**
- [ ] **(Optional) Make `glide_time` modulatable/automatable.** It's deliberately
  `.modulatable(false)` on every module because `OscGlide` doesn't read
  `ParamModOffsets`/automation overrides for it — marking it modulatable without
  that would be a silent-drop bug (`is_automatable()` also gates on `modulatable`).
  To let an LFO/automation sweep the glide time, have `OscGlide` consume the mod
  offset for `glide_time`. **S–M.**
- [ ] **(Optional) Per-note glide + stepped glissando, per-oscillator.** The
  per-note glide (tracker import, `GlideState::start_from`) and stepped/glissando
  voice glides stay voice-level; a per-osc glide is always continuous. Mirror them
  per-oscillator only if a use case appears.

### 2.7 Mod Grid follow-ups

Mod Grid has shipped across the data model, engine, GUI, MCP, persistence, and
offline rendering. Remaining refinements follow.

- [ ] **Optional: fuller live exit-gate walk-through.** Not blocking. For an
  exhaustive pass, verify `LFO → Track 2 volume` with
  no lane; a Track graph on two tracks; `LFO → Pitch` host-only; an Audio-tap duck;
  routing-removal returns to base; a seeded render matches live; `Macro → LFO.rate_cv`;
  a live `MidiCc`; sustain hold+release.
- [ ] **Per-graph CPU attribution (7.6 refinement).** The header CPU is total across
  all running instances (reuses the per-stage timing). Per-graph cost needs separate
  instrumentation (time each `ModGridInstance` and map to its `ModGraphId`, exposed to
  the GUI). **M.**
- [ ] **Soft cap on Mod Grid assignments.** Once per-graph CPU attribution is available,
  use the measured instance cost to decide whether track-scoped graphs need a soft
  assignment limit. Warn in the GUI when the estimated aggregate cost exceeds the
  budget; do not impose a hard limit unless real projects demonstrate a need. **S–M.**
- [ ] **Sostenuto (CC66) is unmodelled — re-scoped from "S" to "M".** The pedal
  path only handles CC64 (defer NoteOffs while held). **CC67 (soft) is NOT a code
  gap**: all CC state already feeds Mod Grid `MidiCc` sources, so a soft pedal is a
  routing answer today (CC67 → a volume/gain destination). **CC66 (sostenuto)** is a
  real feature but bigger than a CC64 mirror: it must snapshot the keys *down at the
  moment the pedal is pressed* and defer only those NoteOffs (notes struck after are
  not held), which needs new per-channel keys-down tracking + a captured set +
  selective deferral. Do as its own small-M task if a use case appears. Low priority.
- [ ] **CPU metering uses `Instant::now()` every audio callback (review finding 5).**
  The mod-grid stage timing follows the *pre-existing* per-stage pattern (voices /
  module-graph / master-fx already do 4 clock reads per callback). `Instant::now()`
  isn't guaranteed to be a syscall-free vDSO read on every platform, which the RT rules
  frown on, and the reads happen even when the CPU tooltip is hidden. Consider making the
  whole metering opt-in/off-by-default or sampling it sparsely — a cross-cutting change to
  the existing metering subsystem, not mod-grid-specific. **S–M.**

### 2.8 Port value domains — open follow-ups

`PortValueDomain` annotates every port with the value contract it accepts/produces
(`feat/port-value-domains`). Two ports were deliberately left alone during the
review of that branch because fixing them changes audible behaviour or needs a new
domain.

- [ ] **Turing Machine's pitch range is capped at 1 octave by its own storage type.**
  `turing_machine.rs` quantizes to semitones/12 and stores the result in a
  `NormalizedValue`, which clamps to `0..1` — so the `range` parameter's advertised
  "up to 2 octaves" can never exceed one. The port now *documents* the real 0–1
  octave range, but the parameter still lies. Fix by storing the pitch CV in a type
  that carries the full range (or scaling `range` into 0..1 and multiplying at the
  consumer). **Audible behaviour change** — patches relying on the current clamped
  output will transpose differently. **S.**
- [ ] **`math_oscillator`'s `fm` port has no matching domain.** It uses `apply_fm`
  (2 octaves per unit), which neither `Octaves` (1 octave/unit) nor `Control`
  describes, so it was left on the generic `control` domain while every other 1V/oct
  FM port got annotated. Either add a domain variant for the 2-octave scaling or
  change `math_oscillator` to the standard 1V/oct `apply_cv`. **S.**

## 3. UI & Visual Polish

### 3.5 Drop the vendored egui-0.35 forks once upstream ships 0.35

- [ ] **Replace the vendored `third_party/egui-remixicon` crate with the crates.io version once they publish an
  egui-0.35-compatible release.** The egui 0.34→0.35 upgrade was blocked because neither `egui-remixicon` nor
  `egui-file-dialog` had a 0.35 release at the time (egui 0.35 landed 2026-06-25).
    * Note: `egui-file-dialog` was already successfully upgraded to its official 0.35-native version `0.14.1` on
      crates.io and its fork was dropped.
    * For `egui-remixicon`: when upstream releases a 0.35 version, bump `egui-remixicon` in `Cargo.toml`, remove the
      `[patch.crates-io]` block and the `third_party/egui-remixicon` directory, and verify the build.
      Watch: https://github.com/get200/egui-remixicon

### 3.6 Review the mixer view layout

- [ ] **Give the mixer view (`gui/mixer_view.rs`) a proper layout pass.** The module-header
  consolidation (2026-07-01) shared `draw_module_header`'s right-alignment across the mixer, switched
  its strips to the shared `icon_button`, and sized channel strips / return columns off the
  `ModuleWidth` buckets (`Small` 192 / `Medium` 256) instead of hardcoded 108/200 — which fixed the
  header title/icon overlap but was a spot fix, not a considered layout. Still worth reviewing: overall
  strip proportions and spacing at the new widths, sends/pan/meter/fader arrangement inside a strip, the
  master strip, and how it all reads next to the patch editor. Vertical scrolling was just added
  (`ScrollArea::both`); confirm it behaves with tall strips and many channels.
- [ ] **Track-properties popup is clipped by the pattern panel** (`gui/sequencer/arrangement.rs`,
  seen 2026-07-26). The kebab popup on a track header opens downward and the lower half (Colour
  row) disappears behind the docked pattern editor. Flip or clamp it to the visible area.

## 4. Architectural & Performance Hardening

> **Ground rule: nothing here gets optimized before it is a *measured* problem.**
> Readable, well-structured code wins over speculative micro-optimization. The
> long catalogue of speculative cycle-shaving items (SIMD/alignment, `rem_euclid`
> tricks, mmap, dashmap, PGO, reciprocal-mult, etc.) was **removed on 2026-06-30**
> — it traded clarity for unmeasured gains. The remaining entries are genuine
> correctness/RT-safety issues, but architectural enough to be driven by an
> *actually observed symptom*, not done pre-emptively.

### Trigger-based hardening (do when the symptom appears)

#### Real-time safety: replace HashMap usage on the audio thread

- [ ] **Remove `HashMap` lookups/updates from the audio thread.**
  `last_automation_values`, `track_auto`, `prev_instrument_outputs`, and
  `track_controls` use `std::collections::HashMap` (SipHash 1-3, worst-case O(n) on
  collisions) in `synth_engine.rs` / `sequencer_engine.rs` — a latency-jitter risk.
  Evaluate flat arrays (`[Option<T>; MAX]`) or linear search over small stack
  arrays, which are cache-friendly with deterministic WCET, and can read more
  cleanly. **Trigger: when jitter is actually measured.**

#### DSP: parameter smoothing for CV/cutoff changes

- [ ] **Add parameter smoothing to hot paths.** Sudden block-by-block parameter
  jumps cause audible clicks / "zipper noise". A lightweight smoother (1-pole
  lowpass or sample-rate linear ramp) in oscillators, amplifiers, and filters
  guarantees smooth transitions. An **audible-quality** fix (effectively a small
  feature). **Trigger: when you hear clicks on cutoff/CV moves.**

#### Per-track pre-FX sends and metering for shared instruments

- [ ] **Add per-track accumulators for pre-FX sends and metering.** Track
  volume/pan/mute now resolves through a generation-marked `TrackId` table and is
  applied per voice before the shared instrument effect chain, so shared-instrument
  dry playback is track-correct. Pre-FX sends and meters still aggregate at the
  instrument channel; split those taps per track if a project needs independent
  routing or meters for tracks sharing one instrument. **Trigger: when such a
  project needs separate pre-FX sends or meters.**

## 5. Future features (harvested from retired plan docs)

> **Consolidated 2026-07-13.** The standalone design/status docs that used to live
> under `plans/` were folded in here. Their full text is recoverable from git
> history; only their remaining open work is captured below.

### 5.1 Deferred design work

- [ ] **Cable layering, gradients, and focus mode.** Render cables and flow
  particles transparently in front of module faceplates, colour cross-domain
  cables with a source→destination gradient, and dim cables unrelated to the
  current selection. Keep the existing orthogonal routing and telemetry model;
  this is a scoped visual pass touching `theme.rs`, `cable.rs`, and `wiring.rs`.

### 5.2 Note Grid — deferred earned-escalation

*(from `plans/note-grid.md`; Note Grid shipped + squash-merged to main 2026-07-13 @`65f12900`. Full plan in git history.)*

- [ ] **DAG (branch/merge) escalation** — relax the linear-stream validation; add
  `KeyZoneSplitter`/`VelocitySplitter`/`RoundRobin` + merge semantics
  (connection-sorted concat under the buffer cap). Data model is already
  graph-shaped (no serde change); the hard part is **held-pitch resolution through a
  *branched* upstream** (`expand_pitch` in `note_processor.rs` today assumes one
  linear upstream chain). Value is low (single terminal output, no cross-instrument
  routing) — **only if real usage shows branching is needed**, not scheduled.
- [ ] **Track scope** (`SequencerTrack::note_graph`) — graph over the merged stream
  of all placements on a track: tails across pattern boundaries + the future
  live-input path (Ableton/Bitwig model). Costs: cross-placement look-back source
  material + a freeze-semantics answer.
- [ ] **`NoteScriptGenerator`** (YAMS `note_event` + `emit`) — statement-only 1-to-N
  generation (`emit(pitch,vel,dur[,delay])`, `MAX_SCRIPT_EMITS=16`), purity via the
  same bounded look-back idiom as Delay/Ratchet. Real language-surface work
  (parser/compiler/VM/`yamsfmt`/docs); may need a `StreamOnset`-style anti-stall cap.
- [ ] **`MicrotonalTuner` note-graph module** — per-note detune field + event
  plumbing. Related to §2.2 (alternative tunings) but delivered as a Note Grid node.
- [ ] **Misc later**: per-reference overrides, per-scope `Vec` of graphs,
  cross-track routing, cable telemetry, per-node tracker taps.

### 5.3 SID oscillator — open fidelity follow-ups

*(full spec archived at `docs/sid-oscillator.md`; the `sid` module shipped to main @`d0d872f3`. Expert-review history in git.)*

- [ ] **Oversampled ring/sync bus (ring-mod HF fidelity).** Ring sideband
  *positions* are exact but broadband `compare_spectra` distance holds ~16.9 dB vs
  reSID — pinned to **host-rate ring-edge jitter (~22.7 µs)**: the neighbour's `msb`
  is read once per host sample, outside the oversample loop. Fix needs the source
  `sid` to expose its MSB at the 4× rate (or the sub-sample crossing fraction) — a
  cross-module `msb`-port contract change, out of scope for a local
  `sid_oscillator.rs` edit. The one-sided PolyBLEP fold-flip already shipped (keep
  it).
- [ ] **Golden reSID A/B acceptance re-run.** Re-run the §11 reSID matrix (the
  sid-analyzer harness) as the acceptance gate for the shipped option-C combine /
  ring / `DcBlock` changes.

### 5.4 AccessKit / egui-inspection — deferred

*(from `plans/accesskit-custom-widgets.md`; shipped to main @`c7372dae`, container-level exposure across all views. Full inventory in git history.)*

- [ ] **Per-element canvas drivability.** v1 exposed the big canvases (piano roll,
  tracker, arrangement, keyboard, sample) only at *container* level. Making
  individual notes / tracker cells / keys / clips clickable+queryable via MCP needs a
  per-element `ui.interact(sub_rect, …)` per view — a larger, view-specific effort.
- [ ] **Cables as AccessKit nodes.** Cables are pure paint (no `Response`); v1
  encodes topology on the port labels. A cable-as-node pass (via the `expose_painted`
  escape hatch + AccessKit relations) is optional follow-up.

### 5.5 Sampling & recording backlog

*(from `plans/sampling-plan.md`; feature shipped through v0.262.0. Full P1/P2/P3 backlog + RT-review notes in git history. Related: §2.1.)*

- [ ] **P2 — sample UX/DSP.** Draggable crop/loop handles + preview playback cursor;
  zero-crossing snap (match slope *sign*, not just proximity); loop crossfade
  (static/baked default, keep the original alongside; dynamic dual-read only if loop
  points are modulated); cubic-Hermite interpolation (+ oversample-in-RAM for *short*
  samples only); mini waveform in the Rack; sample-usage tracking; undo/redo for edits.
- [ ] **P3 — stretch.** Sinc resampling, mipmaps for pitch-up anti-alias, disk
  streaming for large files, multi-sample zones (pull the `SampleZone` data model
  earlier to avoid a voice/GUI rewrite), slicing, timestretch, granular
  `GrainSource::Sample`, audio track in the sequencer.

## Maybe later

### Graph-level feedback edges (mostly redundant with Script — only build for audio-rate/UX)

- [ ] **Graph-level feedback loops (allow cycles via a one-block delay).** Was
  `plans/graph-feedback-loops.md` (deleted 2026-07-13; full text in git history). The
  proposal: stop rejecting a cycle-closing cable, tag it `is_feedback`, exclude it from the
  topo sort, and read the source's *previous* block (z⁻ᵇˡᵒᶜᵏ). **Largely redundant** — the
  block-latency feedback it wants already exists for the script path: a `Script` (`scr`) or
  `AudioScript` (`asc`) reads any module output as an **address-based source**
  (`src fb = flt-1.out`), which resolves via `Voice::resolve_source` to that module's
  **previous block's** value (`voice.rs:1277`, `buf[0]`) and does **not** go through
  `validate_connection`/`would_create_cycle` (the cycle check only guards `Connection` cable
  edges). So `flt-1.out → osc-1.fm_amt` (the plan's exit-gate example) is expressible today
  as: `scr-1` reads `src fb = flt-1.out`, writes `out1 = fb * amount`, cable
  `scr-1.out1 → osc-1.fm_amt` (a forward edge, no cycle). `AudioScript` additionally gives
  **sample-accurate** in-module feedback via `state` cells — strictly better than one-block
  latency for loops that fit in one module. **Only build the graph-edge feature if we
  actually want** (a) **audio-buffer-rate** feedback wrapped around *existing* modules
  without reimplementing their DSP in script (the address source yields one control-rate
  scalar/block, not an audio buffer), or (b) the **turnkey "drag a back-edge → feedback
  cable" UX** with a visually distinct feedback arc. Otherwise
  document the script recipe as the supported way to do control/CV-rate feedback.
